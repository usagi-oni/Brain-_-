## Info
originated in Modesto California they took inspiration from a lot of the most influential  post progressive bands like circa survive and Dance Gavin Dance. They were able to develop their own unique sound focusing more on dynamic shifts, lush chords and blending polyrhythms. Their debut album was “Lavender Town” which is a reference to the town in Pokémon. its a nod to the creepy and atmospheric village, which was a pretty cool reference!

#### My Thoughts
Like i said I've gone to see them in concert and they are just so much fun. their songs make me want to dance and i love how hyped and excited they were to play which influenced me to listen to their lyrics more and i love the beats and sound of the band overall.

The thought that’s aching inside your brain  
Facial expressions well explained without thinking, without thinking"
