## Info
The band originated around 2010 in Royal Oak, Michigan when Craig Owens, from Chiodos, wanted to pull together different musicians. It was considered a super group with different collaborators and honestly one of the coolest projects I've seen since it has Vic Fuentes and Johnny Craig (original DGD lead vocalist). They unfortunately only made one EP being “The Hearts Of Lonely People” but it was such a good EP that I listen to it almost everyday. The band was made just to write together as friends and collaborate to have fun! They would randomly preform in different places but as of now its up in the air if the band will ever get together to make music again.

### sound
The band blended lots of different genres in order to achieve a more ambient and experimental sound. they had multiple lead vocalist so there was always different screams, cleans and melodic vocals in their tracks.
#### My Thoughts
I found this one at random as well and completely loved the vibe the band gave off. All the emotions they give off while they sing just proves how much time and effort they put into the lyrics and the group.

This is all that we know, this is everything you want  
If you can’t stand on your own then speak up, let us know  
Tones will change, curtains will drop"
