## Info
 Makari was formed in 2011 by a group of high school friends were motivated to go start a band after their friend came to them with an opportunity to go on tour. They recorded their first ep for the tour and it lead them to pursue a career in music. Their first album was “hyperreal” which jumpstarted their popularity and was my favorite album but they did make a lot of of EP’s. Their name is derived from the Japanese word meaning truth too!
###### Members
- **Andy Cizek**– vocals (joined 2017; also vocalist for Monuments, WVNDER, and other projects)
- **Eric Crisp** – guitar
- **Matt Belcastro** – guitar
- **Morgan Potts** – drums
- **Matt Mehana** – bass
### sound
They have dreamy guitar effects with intricate melodies and are known for their emotional lyricism and dynamic vocal delivery.
#### My Thoughts
I've listened to a couple of their songs and love how fluttery the songs sound, if that makes sense. it sounds whimsical and i love Andy's voice in all the songs since he puts so much emphasis in the sound and emotions in the lyrics.

### *Makari preforming in Chicago*

> "We leave our marks on things that will never be ours  
 The streets are scarred, the trees are carved  
 With names that glow like  
 Diamond rings on one knee in a nice restaurant  
 I'm better now, those dreams are gone"
