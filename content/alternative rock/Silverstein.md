### sound
Their lyrics are are mostly known to be emotionally charged and sang with screamed and melodic choruses. 
#### My Thoughts
I think its super cool that they are considered part of the big wave of bands that pushed the emo and post-hardcore scene and i would listen to them a LOT when i was younger and emotional. i may not listen to them now but now that i brought up the memory of them with this list im going to listen to them again!

>"Finally, something out there that's making sense  
 And it's just another trend carefully hidden in your dress  
 And this cycle's neverending and this fashion's overdone  
 And the further that I run away, the further I'll come back to shelter"
