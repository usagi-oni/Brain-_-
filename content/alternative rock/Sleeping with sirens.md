#### My Thoughts

### **

> "Just open up like a page in a book  
 These words that I'm writing won't be misunderstood 
 If I'm dishonest, bring me back to my knees  
 Show me why I'm even able to speak
 I'll testify, please help me to see  
 Don't close your eyes, keep your eyes on me  
 Open up, open up now (So make me strong)"
