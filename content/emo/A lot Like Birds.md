## Info
The band came from Sacramento California and was made by Micheal Franzino who just invited a lot of different artists to collaborate for their first album “Plan B” which came out in 2009. There really isn't too much information over the band and i only know enough from the time that Kurt joined to when he left since i love his vocals so much.
###### Members
* Kurt Travis - vocals
* Joseph Arrington - drummer
* Andy Cizek - vocals
* Micheal Franzino - guitar

A Lot Like Birds was more focused on that emo/post hardcore vibe. They've had multiple artists involved. I barely started getting into this band but overall they are so so good.
#### My Thoughts
This band has one of my favorite singers ever, even if he didn't start the band! That's my fun fact for this one! My favorite album is "Conversation Piece” which is the album where Kurt Travis joined!
I kind of like what direction they were leading to over the years and thought their origin story was pretty cool. I’m also going to their upcoming concert so yay me!

It's okay, it's okay, oh  
We can't look at you, you're not the same"
