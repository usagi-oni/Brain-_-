## Info
before Today was formed by Vic Fuentes and Tony Fuentes in 1998. This band is extremely like underground as cheesy as that sounds but it's really only because they never blew up. They only have 1 album being “ A Celebration of an Ending” but even with it only having one album I see so much of PTV in it and see why it formed.

### sound
 Just like PTV their lyrics are extremely emotional and involve aspects of screamo in it. Vic's Sound is a lot harsher than in PTV but more like A Flair for the Dramatic. 
#### My Thoughts
very unfortunate that the band broke apart but we did get something good out of it with it being PTV. I mostly started listening to them on accident due to me finding them while looking for more bands like PTV. I always enjoy finding origins from bands that I like because it's super cool to see how they got to where they are now!

We'll try, still strong in chains
Urging the mind to speak until weakness has been disarmed
Disarmed"
