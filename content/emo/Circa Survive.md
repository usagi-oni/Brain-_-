## Info
Circa Survive formed in 2004 by Anthony Green and Colin Frangicetto in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and debuted with “Juturna” in 2005. They have 7 albums with my favorite one being "Juturna". The band was mostly created after Anthony left his other band Saosin (also pretty good) and with a friend went on to recruit members from Taken and This Day Forward (never heard of them)
###### Members

### sound
Anthony has a pretty high pitched voice but it mixes well with the dynamic sound making him sound very passionate when preforming. The vocals are very melodic and have heart aching lyrics which is why I was interested in the first place!
#### My Thoughts
 Circa Survive isn't a band i listen to as often as the others on this list but i love Anthony Green’s vocals and it's what reeled me into the band in the first place. Fun Fact: they had announced just a hiatus around 2022 and this year the lead singer confirmed they were no longer making ANY music. It isn't a fun fact but he made a lot of jokes about it in the recent concert which was pretty funny. Anthony Green was my favorite part of this band and he genuinely made the songs AMAZING. Seeing him live was also just as amazing since he sounds even better.

### *Circa Survive interview with Mo Smith*

> "Misleading at most, I'm supposed to imposter a new you  
And even if you're woken up, keep contact both at once  
We've made mistakes like this  
And I'm just learning"
