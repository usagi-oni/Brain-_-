### sound
Their lyrics are pretty emotional and are a little more gothic than most of the bands on here. Like i said they are probably one of the most emo style popular bands in the 2000’s. Although they decided to step away from that emo sound they were and probably still care the picture of Emo.
#### My Thoughts
My Chemical Romance is probably the most well known band on this list and isn't really my favorite but really did help me lean a lot towards emo music along with PTV. They also helped influence a lot of my style since they were pretty gothic and I just loved all them with the black
suits and crazy looking makeup! by far my favorite album is “Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge”.

>"What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)"
