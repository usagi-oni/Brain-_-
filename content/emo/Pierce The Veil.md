## Info
pierce the veil is an emo post hardcore band based from San Diego, California. The band has about five albums out, with their first one releasing in 2007 named “A Flair For The Dramatic”, which is also my favorite. Fun fact, originally Vic Fuentes had stared in before today before making pierce the veil which ended up becoming one of the most popular emo bands in the 2000’s. His brother used to be in the band (Tony Fuentes) but due to a very serious allegation he, rightfully, left the band.
##### Members
* **Vic Fuentes** - lead singer
* **Tony Perry** - guitar
* **Jaime Preciado** - bass
### sound
Their lyrics consist of very emotional and they also do dabble a bit in the screamo genre with a bit of a latin mix in it since they wanted to have their culture involved in their music giving it a sort of mexicore to it.
#### My Thoughts
Over all this band has a special place in my heart since a lot of their music got me through my wonderfully emotional teenage years.

### *Their tour in Nuremberg, Germany in 2017*

>"Do you think you'd better love me back? 
You said you want someone who actually cares
But I'll say what I want because nobody's around when I talk
It feels better to fall asleep alone ('Cause that's the only way I know)"
