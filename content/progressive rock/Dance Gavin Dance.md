## Info
Dance Gavin Dance originates from Sacramento California and started making music in 2005. The band was made up from two different bands, farewell unknown and left apart. The funny thing about the band is their frequent changes of singers as they’ve had about 4. The changes mostly stem from controversies but only one left willingly! The band has 11 albums starting with “Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean”. My favorite is actually their second album “Downtown Battle Mountain II” and I literally love ALL the songs on there! 
###### Members
- **Will Swan** – Lead guitar, backing vocals, also does unclean vocals in certain eras. 
- **Matt Mingus** – Drums
- **Jon Mess** – Unclean vocals
- **Andrew Wells** – Clean vocals and rhythm guitar
### sound
 The band Since the band has changed over the years they don’t have a very distinct sound except probably the fast paced guitar rifts. A lot of the earlier sounds were emotional and very soul like. The band still has that emotional sound but now its more of a mixture of styles like funk and screamo.  
#### My Thoughts
Dance Gavin dance is one of my favorite bands of all time honestly. I listen to them on a daily basis and have been a loyal follower for about 5 years! I've probably met them a handful of times and love how open they are about answering questions about songs and how meaningful a lot of them are. they have a very special place in my heart and i can honestly listen to most, if not all their songs on repeat!
