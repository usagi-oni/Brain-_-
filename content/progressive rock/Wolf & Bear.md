## Info

Wolf & Bear originated in Sacramento, California, in 2013 (I’ve noticed a lot of these bands originated around the same spots lol). They have about 2 full albums with “Everything Is Going Grey” being their first, that one is also my favorite out of the two. A lot of their influences were bands in their local scene and across the central valley.

### sound
Originally the band wanted to “Expand on the progressive rock genre” which explains their melodic hardcore style. They received a lot of recognition over their dynamic blend of clean and unclean vocals, intricate guitar work and complex rhythms.
#### My Thoughts
They incorporate many different genres very well and although they aren’t my favorite on here they’re pretty solid. They also helped me learn more about the "Swancore" genre since they are a one of the big bands representing it.
