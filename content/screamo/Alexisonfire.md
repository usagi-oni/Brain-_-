## Info

Alexisonfire joined the post-hardcore scene in 2001 coming from St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. two of the local bands in the area decided to collaborate and they ended up with the beautiful sounds of "alexisonfire". their name came from their discovery of a web article about a contortionist stripper named "Alexis Fire" and they ended up with legal issues because of the name but got to keep it. Their First album out was their self titled which is my favorite one!

### sound
hey had the idea to create a sound mixed with melodic singing, chaotic, screaming and dynamic instrumentation which wasn't really done at the time. this and their chemistry helped them stand out and gain massive popularity at the time. They were Chaotic and emotional throughout all their songs and used three singers in order to achieve screamed, clean and melodic vocals. All their music was intense and aggressive but they were able to blend this sound with melody and atmosphere to create the perfect type of post-hardcore screamo. They are also considered one of the pioneering bands in the scene in the 2000's, influencing a lot of up and coming bands with their sound.
#### My Thoughts
I barely started listing to this band but i love their first album and how intense everything is. its that type of music you want to jump around and throw and break things.
