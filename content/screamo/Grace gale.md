## Info
Grace Gale is a smaller band compared to the many on this list. they originate from Denver, Colorado around 2005. their first album "A Few Easy Steps to Secure Heli‑Camel Safety" which is the only one I've listened to but i really really enjoy the way it sounds and it feels new compared to most screamo I've heard. their work is heavier and more influenced by hardcore music but for their second album they switched to a more melodic rock sound.  they had a pretty decent underground following from myspace and online and through lots and lots of touring. although the band isn't together anymore a lot of their live shows were extremely lively and they had a strong DIY work ethic.

### sound
Grace Gale is very aggressive with crazy tempo changes and in your face screams that i simply wasn't used to in most screamo music.   Their lyrics and attitude throughout their songs include humor and  tongue-in-cheek elements which sets them apart form the usual emotional scene they're in especially since they don't take themselves too seriously. 
#### My Thoughts
I was introduced to Grace Gale very recently but think they're pretty funny and love how they mess around with their lyrics and sound. very experimental over all but i enjoy that there's people who want to have fun with their music.

 Self pity is rough here  
 Such a far way to walk and  
 It's too deep  
 I got a chill (You're cold, so fucking cold)  
 Fate calls me out for winding up dead"
