## Info
Hail The Sun originated in 2009 coming from Chico, California when a group of college students had shared interest and decided to start a band together. They were influenced by bands like, Circa Survive, DGD, and Fall Of Troy, so they decided they could build upon that style. i also didn't know but when they first started Donovan, their lead singer, would be both lead singer and drummer. They had what they call the DIY ethic which means they took it upon themselves to release their own music and play at local shows to build their own grassroots. Their first real album is "POW! Right in the kisser" but honestly their whole EP "Elephantitis" is my favorite.
###### Members

### sound
they have a mixture of complex guitar work and a lot of erupt tempo changes and philosophical and introspective lyrics compared to the other bands on this list.
#### My Thoughts
Their love for music is what really makes me love this band because i like completely understand and makes them really relatable. I started listening to them in high school and can still jam out to their EP on repeat!
