## Info
Hawthorne Heights formed in Dayton, Ohio in 2001 and were originally called "A day in the Life" but decided to change their name to fit their more darker and poetic tones. Their first album was "The Silence in Black and White" which honestly is the only one i listen to since i listened to this band more during high school!
###### Members
- **JT Woodruff** – lead vocals/rhythm guitar
- **Casey Calvert** – guitar/screamed vocals - passed away
- **Micah Carli** – lead guitar
- **Matt Ridenour** – bass/backing vocals
- **Eron Bucciarelli** – drums
### sound
 They are most known for their emotional lyrics and clean yet harsh screamed vocals. they originally didn't have that screamo sound and instead shifted a lot of their sound to refine it to what they have today. 
#### My Thoughts
overall i think JT's voice is very distinct and a very good example of that era the original screamed vocals as well since they are so harsh and forced made their music very unique in the screamo scene.

>"I sleep with one eye open so I can see you breathing (_I sleep with one eye open_)  
 I follow your chest home until I (_So I can see you breathing_)  
 I can see you, I can hear you breathe in, exhale  
 The silence in black and white"
