## Info
Saosin made their come up in 2003 coming from Orange County, California. guitarist Beau and bassist Chris began writing music for their band and had the great idea to mix metalcore with melodic and emotional vocals. funny enough they recruited Anthony Green, who later formed Circa Survive, as their vocalist when the band was still active. i don't know if its very noticeable but a lot of the bands i like are very interconnected lol. the name originated from a Chinese proverb which means "small heart", Anthony choose this name as a reference to impermanence. Anthony also did leave the band for a while due to creative differences and personal issues but he did come back around 2014 as a fill in but the band currently shares the singers with cove also singing . their first album "i have become what i always hated" came out in 2003 and gained massive popularity but my favorite is their EP "Translating the name" with the song "seven years".

### sound
helped define the screamo/emo explosion of the mid 2000s with their blend of emotional vocals and technical musicianship. Anthony Green always comes in clutch with his high-pitched vocals and intensity.  
#### My Thoughts
Like Circa survive i didn't really listen too much to Saosin but i still really loved the lyrics and how emotional the songs sound. it all seems like it was made with strong meanings and I'm a huge geek for music like that.

Is something that I could never do  
That was why, staple the eyes and  
Seven dates for me to sell machines  
And tear on"
